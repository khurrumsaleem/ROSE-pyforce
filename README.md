## Description

*pyforce* is a Python package implementing Data-Driven Reduced Order Modelling (DDROM) techniques for applications to multi-physics problems, mainly set in the **Nuclear Engineering** world. The package is part of the **ROSE (Reduced Order modelling with data-driven techniques for multi-phySics problEms)**: mathematical algorithms aimed at reducing the complexity of multi-physics models (for nuclear reactors applications), at searching for optimal sensor positions and at integrating real measures to improve the knowledge on the physical systems.

With respect to the previous original implementation based on [dolfinx](https://github.com/FEniCS/dolfinx) package (v0.6.0), version 1.0.0 of *pyforce* has been completely re-written using `pyvista` as backend for mesh importing, computing integrals, and visualisation of results; in addition, functions are stored as `numpy` arrays, improving the ease of use of the package. **This choice allows to use *pyforce* with any software solver able to export results in VTK format.**

The techniques implemented here follow the same underlying idea expressed in the following figure: in the offline (training) phase, a dimensionality reduction process retrieves a reduced coordinate system onto which encodes the information of the mathematical model; the sensor positioning algorithm then uses this set to select the optimal location of sensors according to some optimality criterion, which depends on the adopted algorithm. In the online phase, the DA process begins, retrieving a novel set of reduced variables and then computing the reconstructed state through a decoding step [Riva et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apm.2024.06.040).

</p>

At the moment, the following techniques have been implemented:

- **Singular Value Decomposition** (randomised), with Projection and Interpolation for the Online Phase
- **Proper Orthogonal Decomposition** with Projection and Interpolation for the Online Phase
- **Empirical Interpolation Method**, either regularised with Tikhonov or not
- **Generalised Empirical Interpolation Method**, either regularised with Tikhonov or not
- **Parameterised-Background Data-Weak formulation**
- **SGreedy** algorithm for optimal sensor positioning
- an **Indirect Reconstruction** algorithm to reconstruct non-observable fields

This package is aimed to be a valuable tool for other researchers, engineers, and data scientists working in various fields, not only restricted in the Nuclear Engineering world.

## Installation

It is recommended to install the package in a conda environment, although it is not strictly required.

The simplest way to install the package is through using `pip`, including all the dependencies.

**Here's how**: at first, clone the repository (this will clone the official one)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ERMETE-Lab/ROSE-pyforce.git
cd ROSE-pyforce
```

*If you want to install the development version*, clone the repo from Steriva's account

```bash
git clone --branch development --single-branch https://github.com/ERMETE-Lab/ROSE-pyforce.git
cd ROSE-pyforce
```

then install the package using `pip` (this will work if you already have `python` and `pip` installed, it might not be true for `miniconda` installations):

```bash
python -m pip install pyforce/
```

Another option is also provided adopting the `environment.yml` file as follows (If you face issues with rendering figures with `pyvista`, this might solve the problem):

```bash
conda env create -f pyforce/environment.yml
conda activate pyforce-env
python -m pip install pyforce/
```

The requirements are listed [here](https://github.com/ERMETE-Lab/ROSE-pyforce/blob/main/pyforce/requirements.txt).
