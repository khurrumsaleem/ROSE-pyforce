**pyforce: Python Framework data-driven model Order Reduction for multi-physiCs problEms**

## Description

*pyforce* is a Python package implementing Data-Driven Reduced Order Modelling (DDROM) techniques for applications to multi-physics problems, mainly set in the **Nuclear Engineering** world. These techniques have been implemented upon the [dolfinx](https://github.com/FEniCS/dolfinx) package (currently v0.6.0), part of the [FEniCSx](https://fenicsproject.org/) project, to handle mesh generation, integral calculation and functions storage. The package is part of the **ROSE (Reduced Order modelling with data-driven techniques for multi-phySics problEms)**: mathematical algorithms aimed at reducing the complexity of multi-physics models (for nuclear reactors applications), at searching for optimal sensor positions and at integrating real measures to improve the knowledge on the physical systems.

The techniques implemented here follow the same underlying idea expressed in the following figure: in the offline (training) phase, a dimensionality reduction process retrieves a reduced coordinate system onto which encodes the information of the mathematical model; the sensor positioning algorithm then uses this set to select the optimal location of sensors according to some optimality criterion, which depends on the adopted algorithm. In the online phase, the DA process begins, retrieving a novel set of reduced variables and then computing the reconstructed state through a decoding step.
